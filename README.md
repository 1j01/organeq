## Development Setup

You just need an HTTP server.

<!-- `live-server` is included in `package.json` so if you have Node.js installed, you can `npm i` and run `npm start` -->

<!-- or install it globally -->

<!-- or.. -->

if you have Node.js, you should be able to run `npx live-server` for a really nice auto-reloading one
